# Lab Overview

This is an overview of suggested ways to experiment with the wave function collapse project.

## Lab 1

In this most basic lab you get a few suggestions on how to tinker with the wfc algorithm in its basic implementation without the need to code anything on your own. Read the [lab 1 description](lab1.md) to get acquainted with the wfc algorithm.

## Lab 2

This lab will challenge you to add a bit of code to enhance the implementation included in the project. Very doable if you have a little programming experience. If you want to continue with this, read on in the [lab 2 description](lab2.md).

## Lab 3

This lab is a bit more involved. It explains the wfc algorithm, but you get to implement it on your own. Of course you could just peek at the included implementation, nobody will blame you. Read on in the [lab 3 description](lab3.md).
